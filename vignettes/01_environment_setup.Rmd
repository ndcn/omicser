Creating and running your own browser requires both Python and R.
We provide two different options for installing and setting up 
the environment you'll use when creating your browser:

- [Setup via R](#setup-via-r)
- [Setup via command line](#setup-via-command-lin)

Regardless of which approach you use,
you'll also need to install [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
for later steps in this tutorial.
This project was developed using R version 4.1.0 and RStudio v1.4.1717.

## Setup via R

First, let's install the R tools we'll use to create and manage our other installations:

```{r, RM-install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("reticulate")
```

> Installing the `omicser` browser package in the next tutorial will also install additional R packages as dependencies.

We will use a [conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) 
to manage the Python packages handling data on the back end of the browser application.
We can use R to install **Python version 3.9** and other necessary Python packages
by creating a conda environment using `reticulate`:

```{r RM-r_env, eval=FALSE}
YOUR_CONDA_ENV <- "omxr"
PYTHON_VERSION <- 3.9

library(reticulate)
reticulate::install_miniconda() 
reticulate::conda_create(YOUR_CONDA_ENV, python_version = PYTHON_VERSION)
```

We'll now install Python packages into this conda environment that are required in the example scripts used later in this tutorial.
Please note that if you have bioconductor configured as a channel it may cause problems.
Forcing install from the "conda-forge" channel is preferred:

```{r RM-r_scanpy, eval=FALSE}
reticulate::conda_install(envname= YOUR_CONDA_ENV,
                          channel = "conda-forge",
                          packages = c("scanpy", "leidenalg") )
```

If you have successfully complete all steps in this section,
you are now ready for [Installation](02_install.md). 

## Setup via command line

If you prefer to work on the command line,
the following instructions demonstrate how to use the shell to set up your environment
(examples for MacOSX):

First, download and install Miniconda:

```{bash, conda_inst, eval = FALSE}
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -o ~/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda.sh -p $HOME/miniconda
```

You may need to respond to some prompts in your Console to complete this installation.

Now we can use conda to install a python 3.9 environment to use with `reticulate`. 
For this example we've called the environment `omxr`.
Installing the python packages `scanpy` and `leidenalg` will ensure all additional python requirements are installed:

```{bash, conda_env, eval = FALSE}
conda create --name omxr python=3.9 -c conda-forge scanpy leidenalg                                                                           
conda activate omxr
```

If you have successfully complete all steps in this section,
you are now ready for [Installation](02_install.md).

## Troubleshooting

### `reticulate` and `conda`

If you have difficulty loading `scanpy` (e.g., "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scanpy'"),
you can check the details of your Python environment:

```{r}
reticulate::py_discover_config()
```

Because you used `reticulate` to create an environment for you 
with the relevant packages installed,
you should see your environment name ("omxr")
listed in the Python paths
(e.g., `r-miniconda/envs/omxr/bin/python`).

If you do not see your environment listed in the paths,
you can load your environment:

```{r}
reticulate::use_condaenv(condaenv = "omxr", required = TRUE)
```

This may also require you to restart your R session.
